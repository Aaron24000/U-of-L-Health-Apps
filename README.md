For the past 2 months, I've taken the time to learn Python to get into software development. I wanted to think of a way to help make simple tasks go faster, so I learned PyAutoGui. I created Python scripts for each thing that we install, and I plan on adding them together and incorporating "getpass" for passwords to our network drives. I recently learned GitHub, so let me know your initial thoughts, I'd greatly appreciate the feedback!
